## Currency Converter API

A reactive Spring Boot application providing currency and cryptocurrency conversion rates with historical data support.  
Designed as a monolithic API to fetch, cache, and store exchange rates using Redis and MongoDB.

## Features

- Fetches fiat currency exchange rates from external APIs and caches them in Redis.
- Fetches cryptocurrency rates every N (default 5) minutes, caches in Redis, and stores snapshots in MongoDB (default every hour).
- Provides endpoints to convert currencies and retrieve historical exchange rate data.
- Uses reactive programming with Spring WebFlux and Reactive MongoDB for high performance.
- Configurable cache TTL and scheduler cron expressions via application properties.
- History stored standardized against USD for simplified conversions.
- Logs and metrics can be integrated with Micrometer, Prometheus, and Grafana (optional).

## Technology Stack

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot (Reactive)
- Spring WebFlux
- MongoDB (NoSQL document store)
- Redis (in-memory cache with TTL)
- External Currency APIs (fiat and crypto)
- JUnit 5 + Mockito + Testcontainers for testing
- Docker + Docker Compose

## API Endpoints
### All endpoints are also available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`
- `POST /convert?from={from}&to={to}&amount={amount}` - Convert amount from one currency to another.
- `GET /history?from={from}&to={to}&startDate={startDate}&endDate={endDate}` - Get historical exchange rates.

## How it works

- ###  Fetching Rates:
  - Fiat currency rates are fetched hourly from a public API and cached in Redis with a TTL slightly longer than the scheduler interval.
  - Cryptocurrency rates are fetched every N minutes and cached similarly (default every 5 minutes).
  - Additionally, snapshots of crypto rates are saved into MongoDB for historical queries (default hourly).
 
- ### Data Storage:
  - Redis stores the most recent exchange rates with TTL for fast access.
  - MongoDB stores timestamped rate history documents for currencies standardized against USD.

- ### Conversion Logic:
  - Conversion between any two currencies (fiat or crypto) is done via their USD exchange rate.
  - Historical conversions use the stored hourly snapshots in MongoDB.
